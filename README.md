# ExoPower: EMG-Controlled Upper Limb Exoskeleton

This repository contains all code related to the ExoPower system ‚Äî a wearable, single-arm exoskeleton driven by surface electromyography (sEMG) signals for real-time intent recognition and motor-assisted elbow flexion. The system supports live classification, actuator control, and cloud-based data synchronization.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### `arduinoRun/`
Arduino-side programs for real-time EMG acquisition, signal preprocessing, timestamp tracking, and MQTT transmission.
- `ReadSignal/`: Reads EMG signals after basic filtering and transmits them via serial communication.
- `timestep/`: Extends ReadSignal by adding millisecond-precision timestamps to each data point.
- `cloud/`: Builds upon timestep to publish timestamped EMG data to MQTT topics, enabling wireless transmission to another device or cloud endpoint.
- `baoluo/`: Extracts the envelope of the EMG signal (i.e., smoothed amplitude) to facilitate cleaner classification input or visualization.

This folder contains Arduino sketches corresponding to the hardware-side signal processing pipeline. Each step builds incrementally on the previous, forming the core data path from muscle activation to remote data use.


### `AnalyzeData/`
Scripts for EMG data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

- `A_RecordDataset.py`: Interactive script for collecting and labeling raw EMG data.
- `B_trainModel_RF.py`: Train a Random Forest classifier on extracted features.
- `B_trainModel_LSTM.py`: Train an LSTM-based model for temporal classification.
- `B_trainModel_xgbModel.py`: Train an XGBoost model for EMG classification.
- `C_CompareModelTraining.py`: Compare performance across the three classifiers.
- `C_simRealTime_RF.py`: Simulate real-time prediction using pre-recorded EMG data and RF model.
- `D_realTime_RF.py`: Real-time prediction using EMG sensor input and Random Forest model.
- `D_realTime_LSTM.py`, `D_realTime_xgbModel.py`: Real-time pipelines for other models.

### `model/`
Saved models trained with the scripts above.

- `rfModel.pkl`: Trained Random Forest model (used in real-time deployment).
- `lstm_emg_model.pt`: Trained LSTM model (PyTorch).
- `xgbModel.pkl`: Trained XGBoost model.

### `motor/`
Scripts for real-time actuator control using Dynamixel servos.

- `A_EMGMotor_RealControl.py`: Core script for EMG-driven motor actuation.
- `B_EMGMotor_simControl.py`: Simulated control logic without hardware.
- Other files: Additional PID-based experiments and motor control modes.

### `upload/`
Scripts for MQTT-based communication and cloud integration with AWS IoT Core.

- `mqttUpload.py`: Reads EMG sensor data and publishes via MQTT to another device.
- `aws_subscribe.py`: Subscribes to MQTT topic and forwards data to AWS.
- `cloud.py`, `read.py`: Auxiliary cloud communication and debug scripts.
- `emg02.cert.pem`, `emg02.private.key`, `root-CA.crt`: AWS IoT security credentials.
- `signal_1.csv`: Sample labeled EMG dataset used for testing.
