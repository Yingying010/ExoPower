# ExoPower: EMG-Controlled Upper Limb Exoskeleton

This repository contains all code related to the ExoPower system ‚Äî a wearable, single-arm exoskeleton driven by surface electromyography (sEMG) signals for real-time intent recognition and motor-assisted elbow flexion. The system supports live classification, actuator control, and cloud-based data synchronization.
